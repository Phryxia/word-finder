# English Word Finder

Just for fun. Maybe you can solve the famouse game: wordle with this.

You can find some english words with some conditions. I'm just thinking to add followings (or not)

- Advanced features for IT experts who don't want to code entire things by his/herself.
  - Using regex
  - Free conditions using JavaScript/TypeScript
- Some funny statistics to the question like
  - which alphabet is the most used one
  - which alphabet is the most being followed by others (ex: `aa` vs `ab`)
- i18n
  - Extends word for other languages

At first I didn't have any idea how to make this more advanced, so I've just grabbed without enough research for the proper dictionary. Currently used dictionary can be downloaded from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/54982015/3811223). Put `DA.json` ~ `DZ.json` files into `public/dict`. But I'm gonna change it to better one like [this](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words) in near future. Maybe I would have to fix licnese issues when I want to earn a little money to serve this at somewhere.
